# The Blue Alliance Universal App

## Why a universal app

This project is designed to unify three repos under one codebase

* https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android
* https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-ios
* https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-pwa

The goal is that by having one codebase, features can be rolled out 
to all users at the same time with as little if no differences.

## Why Flutter?

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is a toolkit contributed to by Google LLC.
which allows for elegant cross-platform development under one codebase
using the [Dart Language](https://dart.dev/).

Flutter can be comparable to Microsoft's 
[Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) which only targets
Android and iOS applications while Flutter targets...

* Android
* iOS
* Web (Beta)
* MacOS (Alpha)
* Linux ("are in development")
* Windows ("are in development")

By targeting the first three platforms, we are able to support every major
**mobile** platform or any mobile/desktop platform that supports a modern web browser.
